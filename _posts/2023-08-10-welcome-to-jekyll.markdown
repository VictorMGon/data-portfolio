Hello world! This is my first post using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. I'm excited to share my thoughts and projects with you. Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator that lets me write posts in Markdown or HTML. GitHub Pages is a service that hosts my site for free on GitHub. Together, they make a powerful combination for anyone who wants to share their thoughts and projects online.
